# A collection of useful libraries for x86 assembly ğŸ¥µ

%include the files in your assembly project and follow the comments to know how to use each function

| File                         | Contents                                                               |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `foor_loops.asm`             | Implementations of the for loop                                        |
| `math.asm`                   | Mathematical functions                                                 |
| `quit.asm`                   | Code to quit the program                                               |
| `stdio.asm`                  | Functions for input and output                                         |
| `stdlib.asm`                 | Systems interactions, atoi and itoa                                    |
| `string.asm`                 | Functions for string manipulation                                      |

## TODO 
- [ ] Add a library for math functions
- [ ] Add functions to work on files
- [ ] Add functions to work on sockets
- [ ] Implement more string functions
